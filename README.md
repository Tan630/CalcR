This application implements shunting-yard algorithm to evaluate simple mathematical expressions.

This application is built in a way that enables modifications: by providing a custom Token class, one can configure said PDA to recognize a plethora of mathematical expressions provided they are all in infix format. Infix operators yet to be supported.
